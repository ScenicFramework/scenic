# Changelog

## 0.10.0
* PR to fix delete the children of a group when the group itself is deleted. Thanks to Chris Boebel. @cboebel
* Improve building the C products. PR #126 - @fhunleth
* Added a :parser option to Cache.File.read/load to allow custom interpreters
* Much improved error handling when a scene crashes during its init phase. Instead of quickly
  restarting the scene over and over, it now goes to an error scene that displays debug info.
  Also displays that info in the command line.
* Added a ViewPort.reset() function (used by the error scene), which can be used to send
  a ViewPort back to the original scene it was started with.


## 0.9.0
* Much improved testing
* Much improved documentation
* Simplify rules around user-closing a viewport
* Fix bug where captured positional inputs were not casting the transformed location
* Deprecated Graph.get_root(). Use Graph.get!(graph, :\_root\_) instead.
* Renamed Primitive.put_opts to Primitive.merge_opts
* Deprecated Primitive.put_style(w/list). Use Primitive.merge_opts(...) instead.
* Deprecated Primitive.put_transform(w/list). Use Primitive.merge_opts(...) instead.
* Add Graph.find/2
* Add Graph.modify/3 with a finder function
* Rename Cache.request_notification/1 -> Cache.subscribe/1

## 0.8.0

* Many documentation improvements
* Rename `Scenic.Cache.Hash.compute/2` to `Scenic.Cache.Hash.binary/2`
* Rename `Scenic.Cache.Hash.compute_file/2` to `Scenic.Cache.Hash.file/2`
* Add `Scenic.Cache.Hash.binary!/2`
* Rename `Scenic.Cache.Hash.compute_file!/2` to `Scenic.Cache.Hash.file!/2`
* Add ability to put master styles and transforms in a ViewPort config.
* Fold Scenic.Math into the main Scenic project
* Cursor input is now only sent if the mouse is actually over a primitive. This
  solves an inconsistency where sometimes the incoming point would be in local
  coordinate space and sometimes it would be global. If you want to capture that
  sort of input, either cover the space with a clear rect, or capture the input.
* Add the `:direction` option to the `Dropdown` component so can can go either
  up or down.
* Add specs to functions in components and primitives
* Add the Toggle component. Thank you to Eric Watson. @wasnotrice
