# convenience functions for adding basic primitives to a graph.
# this module should be updated as new primitves are added

defmodule Scenic.Primitives do
  alias Scenic.Primitive
  alias Scenic.Graph

  # import IEx

  @moduledoc """
  A set of helper functions to make it easy to add to, or modify,
  a graph.

  In general, each helper function is of the form
      def name_of_primitive( graph, data, opts \\\\ [] )

  When adding primitives to a graph, each helper function accepts a
  graph as the first parameter and returns the transformed graph. This
  makes is very easy to buid a complex graph by piping helper functions
  together.

      @graph Graph.build()
      |> text( "Hello World" )
      |> rectangle( {100, 200} )
      |> line( {{10,20}, {100, 20}})


  When modifying a graph, you can again use the helpers by passing
  in the primitive to be modified. The transformed primitive will
  be returned.

      Graph.modify(graph, :rect, fn(p) ->
        rectangle(p, {200, 300})
      end)

      # or, more compactly...

      Graph.modify(graph, :rect, &rectangle(&1, {200, 300}) )

  In each case, the second parameter is a data term that is specific
  to the primitive being acted on. See the documentation below. If you
  pass in invalid data for the second parameter an error will be
  thrown along with some explanation of what it expected.

  The third parameter is a keyword list of options that are to be
  applied to the primitive. This includes setting the id, styles,
  transforms and such.

      @graph Graph.build()
      |> text( "Hello World", id: :hello, font_size: 24, rotate: 0.4 )
      |> rectangle( {100, 200}, translate: {10, 30}, fill: :yellow)
      |> line( {{10,20}, {100, 20}}, id: :a_line, stroke: {4, :green})

  ### Style options

  Style options affect the way primitives are drawn. They include options such
  as :fill, :stroke, :font and many more. See the Styles documentation
  for the full list. Style options are inherited down the graph. In other words,
  if you set a style on the root of the graph like this:
  Graph.build( font_size: 24, then all text items in all groups will be
  rendered with a point size of 24 unless they set a different size.

  Not every primtitive accepts every style. For example, it doesn't make much
  sense to apply a font to a rectangle. If you try, the rectangle will ignore
  that value. See the documentation for each primitive for a list of what styles
  they pay attention to.

  Transforms that are applied to a Group are inherited by all primitives in
  that group's branch of the tree. Note that style inheritence does not
  cross SceneRef boundaries.

  ### Transform options

  Transform options affect the size, position and rotation of elements in the
  graph. Any transform you can express as a 4x4 matrix of floats, you can apply
  to any primitive in the graph, including groups and scene_refs.

  Transform options are applied on the element they are specified on. If
  you specify a transform on a group, then it is applied to everything
  rendered in that branch of the graph tree.

  This is done mathematically as a "stack" of transforms. As the renderer
  traverses up and down the graph, transforms are pushed and popped from the
  matrix stack as appropriate. Transform inheritence does cross SceneRef
  boundaries.

  ## Draw Order

  Primitives will be drawn in the order you add them to the graph.
  For example, the graph below draws text on top of a filled rectangle. If the order
  of the text and rectangle were reversed, they would both still be rendered, but
  the text would not be visible because the rectangle would cover it up.

      @graph Graph.build( font: {:roboto, 20} )
      |> rect( {100, 200}, color: :blue )
      |> text( "Hello World", id: :hello, translate: {10, 10} )

  ## SceneRef primitives

  The scene_ref/3 helper creates/modifies a SceneRef primitive. This is
  the other special case primitive. Instead of drawing anything directly
  it says something like, "render the graph from another scene here".

  The SceneRef allows you to compose together components made of other
  pre-made scenes, or independently supervised scenes, into a single image.

  The SceneRef follows the same style/transform inheritance as the Group.

  Add an arc to a graph

  An arc is the outer edge of a part of a circle or ellipse. It
  is the sort of thing you would use a compass to draw on a piece
  of paper. It has a radius, a start angle and an ending angle. The
  angles are specified in radians.

  Data:

      {radius, start, finish}

  If you want something that looks like a piece of pie (maybe for a
  pie chart??), then you want a Sector, not an Arc.

  To create an arc of an ellipse, create a normal arc, and apply
  a `:scale` transform with unequal x and y sizing.

  The following example will draw a simple arc with a radius of 100,
  starting straight out to the right, then going down 0.4 radians.

      graph
      |> arc( {100, 0, 0.4} )

  ### Styles

  Arcs honor the following styles

  * `:hidden` - If true the primitive is rendered. If false, it is skipped. The default
    is true.
  * `:fill` - Fills in the interior with the specified paint. If not set, the
    default is to not draw anything in the interior. This is similar to specifying
    fill: :clear, except optimzed out to do nothing.
  * `:stroke` - Draws the outline with the specified width and paint. The default
    if not set is `{1, :white}`

  Example:

      graph
      |> arc( {100, 0, 0.4}, stroke: {4, :blue} )

  """

  Add a Circle to a graph

  Circles are defined by a radius
  Data:

      100

  The following example will draw circle.

      graph
      |> circle( 100 )

  ### Styles

  Circles honor the following styles

  * `:hidden` - If true the primitive is rendered. If false, it is skipped. The default
    is to render the primitive if hidden is not set.
  * `:fill` - Fills in the interior with the specified paint. If not set, the
    default is to not draw anything in the interior. This is similar to specifying
    fill: :clear, except optimzed out to do nothing.
  * `:stroke` - The width and paint to draw the outline with. If the stroke is not
    specified then the default stroke is `{1, :white}`

  Example:

      graph
      |> circle( 40, fill: :red, stroke: {3, :blue}, translate: {100, 200} )

  While you could apply a `:rotate` transform to a circle, it wouldn't do
  anything visible unless you also add a uneven `:scale` transform to make it
  into an ellipse.

  Add an Ellipse to a graph

  Ellipses are defined by two radii.

  Data:

      {100, 140}

  The following example will draw an ellipse.

      graph

  If you want the ellipse to be on an angle, apply a `:rotate` transform.

  ### Styles

  Ellipses honor the following styles

  * `:hidden` - If true the outline is rendered. If false, it is skipped. The default
    is to render the primitive if hidden is not set.
  * `:fill` - Fills in the interior with the specified paint. If not set, the
    default is to not draw anything in the interior. This is similar to specifying
    fill: :clear, except optimzed out to do nothing.

  Create a new branch in a Graph

  The Group primitive creates a new branch in the Graph's tree. The data field
  you pass in is a function callback, which allows you to add more
  primitives inside the new group.

  The single parameter to your anonymous callback is a transformed graph that
  knows to add new primitives to the right branch in the tree.

      @graph Graph.build( )
      |> text( "Hello World" )
      |> group(fn(g) ->
        g
        |> text( "Im in the Group" )
      end, translate: {40,200})

  ### Styles

  Groups will accept all styles. They don't use the styles directly, but
  any styles you set on a group become the new defaults for all primitives
  you add to that group's branch in the graph. Note: styles are not
  inherited across scene_refs. (see below)

  The `:hidden` is particularly effective when applied to a group as it
  causses that entire branch to be drawn, or not.

  ### Transforms

  Any transforms you apply to a group are added into the render matrix stack and
  are applied to all items in that branch, including crossing scene_refs.

  Update the options of a primitive without changing its data.
