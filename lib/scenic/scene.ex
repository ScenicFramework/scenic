  ## Overview

  Scenes are the core of the UI model.

  A `Scene` has three jobs.

  1. Maintain any state specific to that part of your application.
  1. Build and maintain a graph of UI primitives that gets drawn
  to the screen.
  2. Handle input and events.

  ### A brief aside

  Before saying anything else I want to emphasize that the rest of your
  application, meaning device control logic, sensor reading / writing,
  services, whatever, does not need to have anything to do with Scenes.

  In many cases I recommend treating those as separate GenServers in their
  own supervision trees that you maintain. Then your Scenes would query or send
  information to/from them via cast or call messages.

  Part of the point of using Erlang/Elixir/OTP is separating this sort of
  logic into independent trees. That way, an error in one part of your
  application does not mean the rest of it will fail.

  ## Scenes

  So.. scenes are the core of the UI model. A scene consists of one ore more
  graphs, and a set of event handlers and filters to deal with user input
  and other messages.

  Think of a scene as being a little like an HTML page. HTML pages have:

  * Structure (the DOM)
  * Logic (Javascript)
  * Links to other pages.

  A Scene has:

  * Structure (graphs),
  * Logic (event handlers and filters)
  * Transitions to other scenes. Well... it can request the [`ViewPort`](overview_viewport.html)
  to go to a different scene.

  Your application is a collection of scenes that are in use at various times. There
  is only ever **one** scene showing in a [`ViewPort`](overview_viewport.html) at a given
  time. However, scenes can reference other scenes, effectively embedding their graphs
  inside the main one. More on that below.


  ### [Graphs](Scenic.Graph.html)

  Each scene should maintain at least one graph. You can build graphs
  at compile time, or dynamically while your scene is running. Building
  them at compile time has two advantages

    1. Performance: It is clearly faster to build the graph once during
    build time to to build it repeatedly during runtime.
    2. Error checking: If your graph has an error in it, it is much
    better to have it stop compilation than cause an error during runtime.

  Example of building a graph during compile time:

    @graph  graph.build(font_size: 24)
    |> button({"Press Me", :button_id}, translate: {20, 20})



  Rather than having a single scene maintain a massive graph of UI,
  graphs can reference graphs in other scenes.

  On a typical screen of UI, there is one scene
  that is the root. Each control, is its own scene process with
  its own state. These child scenes can in turn contain other
  child scenes. This allows for strong code reuse, isolates knowledge
  and logic to just the pieces that need it, and keeps the size of any
  given graph to a reasonable size. For example, The graph
  hand handlers of a check-box don't need to know anything about
  how a slider works, even though they are both used in the same
  parent scene. At best, they only need to know that they
  both conform to the `Component.Input` behavior, and can thus
  query or set each others value. Though it is usually
  the parent scene that does that.

  The application developer is responsible for building and
  maintaining the scene's graph. It only enters the world of the
  `ViewPort` when you call `push_graph`. Once you have called
  `push_graph`, that graph is sent to the drivers and is out of your
  immediate control. You update that graph by calling `push_graph`
  again.

  This does mean you could maintain two separate graphs
  and rapidly switch back and forth between them via push_graph.
  I have not yet hit a good use case for that.

  #### Graph ID.

  This is an advanced feature...

  Each scene has a default graph id of nil. When you send a graph
  to the ViewPort by calling `push_graph(graph)`, you are really
  sending it with a sub-id of nil. This encourages thinking that
  scenes and graphs have a 1:1 relationship. There are, however,
  times that you want a single scene to host multiple graphs that
  can refer to each other via sub-ids. You would push them
  like this: `push_graph(graph, id)`. Where the id is any term you
  would like to use as a key.

  There are several use cases where this makes sense.
  1) You have a complex tree (perhaps a lot of text) that you want
  to animate. Rather than re-rendering the text (relatively expensive)
  every time you simply transform a rotation matrix, you could place
  the text into its own static sub-graph and then refer to it
  from the primary. This will save energy as you animate.

  2) Both the Remote and Recording clients make heavy use of sub-ids
  to make sense of the graph being replayed.

  The downside of using graph_ids comes with input handling.
  because you have a single scene handling the input events for
  multiple graphs, you will need to take extra care to correctly
  handle position-dependent events, which may not be projected
  into the coordinate space you think they are. The Remote and
  Recording clients deal with this by rendering a single, completely
  transparent rect above all the sub scenes. This invisible, yet
  present rect hits all the position dependent events and makes
  sure they are sent to the scene projected in to the main
  (id is nil) graph's coordinate space.


  ### Communications

  Scenes are specialized GenServers. As such, they communicate with each other
  (and the rest of your application) through messages. You can receive
  messages with the standard `handle_info`, `handle_cast`, `handle_call` callbacks just
  like any other scene.

  Scenes have two new event handling callbacks that you can *optionally* implement. These
  are about user input vs UI events.


  ## Input vs. Events

  Input is data generated by the drivers and sent up to the scenes
  through the `ViewPort`. There is a limited set of input types and
  they are standardized so that the drivers can be built independently
  of the scenes. Input follows certain rules about which scene receives them

  Events are messages that one scene generates for consumption
  by other scenes. For example, a `Component.Button` scene would
  generate a `{:click, msg}` event that is sent to its parent
  scene.

  You can generate any message you want, however, the standard
  component libraries follow certain patterns to keep things sensible.

  ## Input Handling

  You handle incoming input events by adding `handle_input/3` functions
  to your scene. Each `handle_input/3` call passes in the input message
  itself, an input context struct, and your scene's state. You can
  then take the appropriate actions, including generating events
  (below) in response.

  Under normal operation, input that is not position dependent
  (keys, window events, more...) is sent to the root scene. Input
  that does have a screen position (cursor_pos, cursor button
  presses, etc...) Is sent to the scene that contains the
  graph that was hit.

  Your scene can "capture" all input of a given type so that
  it is sent to itself instead of the default scene for that type.
  this is how a text input field receives the key input. First,
  the user selects that field by clicking on it. In response
  to the cursor input, the text field captures text input (and
  maybe transforms its graph to show that it is selected).

  Captured input types are should be released when no longer
  needed so that normal operation can resume.

  The input messages re not passed on to other scene if
  the first one doesn't handle it.

  ## Event Filtering

  In response to input, (or anything else... a timer perhaps?),
  a scene can generate an event (any term), which is sent backwards
  up the tree of scenes that make up the current aggregate graph.

  In this way, a `Component.Button` scene can generate a`{:click, msg}`
  event that is sent to its parent. If the parent doesn't
  handle it, it is sent to that scene's parent. And so on util the
  event reaches the root scene. If the root scene doesn't handle
  it either then the event is dropped.

  To handle events, you add `filter_event/3` functions to your scene.
  This function handle the event, and stop its progress backwards
  up the graph. It can handle it and allow it to continue up the
  graph. Or it can transform the event and pass the transformed
  version up the graph.

  You choose the behavior by returning either

      {:continue, msg, state}

  or

      {:stop, state}

  Parameters passed in to `filter_event/3` are the event itself, a
  reference to the originating scene (which you can to communicate
  back to it), and your scene's state.

  A pattern I'm using is to handle and event at the filter and stop
  its progression. It also generates and sends new event to its
  parent. I do this instead of transforming and continuing when
  I want to change the originating scene.


  ## No children

  There is an optimization you can use. If you know for certain that your component
  will not attempt to use any components, you can set `has_children` to `false` like this.

      use Scenic.Component, has_children: false

  Setting `has_children` to `false` this will do two things. First, it won't create
  a dynamic supervisor for this scene, which saves some resources. Second,
  `push_graph/1` goes through a fast pass that doesn't scan the graph for dynamic children.

  For example, the Button component sets `has_children` to `false`.

  send a filterable event to a scene.

  This is very similar in feel to casting a message to a GenServer. However,
  This message will be handled by the Scene's `filter_event\3` function. If the
  Scene returns `{:continue, msg, state}` from `filter_event\3`, then the event
  will also be sent to the scene's parent. This will continue until the message
  reaches the root scene or some other permanently supervised scene.

  Typically, when a scene wants to initiate an event, it will call `send_event/1`
  which is a private function injected into the scene during `use Scenic.Scene`

  This private version of send_event will take care of the housekeeping of
  tracking the parent's pid. It will, in turn, call this function on the main
  Scene module to send the event on its way.

      def handle_input( {:cursor_button, {:left, :release, _, _}}, _, %{msg: msg} = state ) do
        send_event( {:click, msg} )
        {:noreply, state}
      end

  On the other hand, if you know you want to send the event to a named scene
  that you supervise yourself, then you would use `Scenic.Scene.send_event/2`

      def handle_input( {:cursor_button, {:left, :release, _, _}}, _, %{msg: msg} = state ) do
        Scenic.Scene.send_event( :some_scene, {:click, msg} )
        {:noreply, state}
      end

  Be aware that named scenes that your supervise yourself are unable to continue
  the event to their parent in the graph because they could be referenced by
  multiple graphs making the continuation ambiguous.
