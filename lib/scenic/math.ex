defmodule Scenic.Math do

  Helper functions that support Scenic mathematical operations.

  The math functions are fairly straightforward. When performance is needed some
  have been broken out into a NIF.

  The NIF functions are currently written for compatibility over top speed and
  as such, there is an opportunity to further improve them by calling out to
  CPU-specific vector instructions in the future.
